## Requirements

Please install all the requirements in `requirements.txt`.

## Training Method


First, we need to **download the architecture-accuracy pairs data**.
```
wget https://github.com/chenyaofo/CTNAS/releases/download/data/nas_bench.json -O ctnas/data/nas_bench.json
```

**Train on NAS-Bench-101**

```
python ctnas/train.py --space nasbench --data ctnas/data/nas_bench.json --train_batch_size 256 --output output/nasbench_search
```
